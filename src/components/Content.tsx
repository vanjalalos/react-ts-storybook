            Backend: we primarily use the Microsoft stack (.NET and SqlServer)
            in the backend. We've been working with .NET since its inception in
            2001. Frontend: we use Typescript and Node everwhere, and mature JS
            frameworks like React or Angular where it makes sense â€” but whenever
            we can, we'll just #UseThePlatform.
